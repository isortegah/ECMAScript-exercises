Where destructuring in ES6 allows you to easily get properties out of an object, this shorthand property syntax allows you to easily push properties in. It's like destructuring backwards.

If I have a firstName and a lastName and I want to create a person, I can just say, {firstName, lastName}. Then when I log out my person and I run this, you can see that it logs out an object with the first name of John and a last name of Lindquist.
```javascript
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Lindquist";

let person = {firstName, lastName}

console.log(person);
```

If I wanted to build some more objects, like I want to build a team. I have a mascot with a Moose, and I wanted to build a team like this, where I have a person and a mascot, and then I log out my team. I have a team object with a  person of {firstName, lastName}, John and Lindquist, with the mascot of Moose.
```javascript
let mascot = "Moose";
let team = {person, mascot};

console.log(team);
```

This syntax allows you to easily construct objects with the properties and things you already have and just build them up however you'd like.
