Default arguments in ES6 allow you to assign some defaults to these guys. If I run this right now you'll see I'll get undefined, undefined because nothing was passed in for greeting or names, so when they get logged out they're both undefined.

```javascript
function greet(greeting, name){
  console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
}

greet();

```
If I want his name to at least default to John, if I don't pass anything in, I can get undefined to John. I didn't pass anything in here, but I said the name should at least be John so it logs out the name as John.

If I pass in Hello here, and then run this, you can see I get Hello, John. Hello comes through the greeting, logged out here as Hello and the name still defaults to John, and then is logged out here.
```javascript
function greet(greeting, name = "John"){
  console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
}

greet("Hello");

```
If I say Hello, Bill, the default will be overridden and I'll get Bill instead of John, because the default was John, but I said explicitly to say Bill.

```javascript
function greet(greeting, name = "John"){
  console.log(greeting + ", " + name);
}

greet("Hello", "Bill");
```

Where this gets a little bit crazier is when you assign a default function to one of the arguments. Right now, complete is undefined, so it will say undefined is not a function when I try to invoke it.

```javascript
function receive(complete){
  complete();
}

receive();
```
But, if I pass in a function and say log complete, and I run this, you can see it logs complete out, because it invokes it when it's passed in.

```javascript
function receive(complete){
  complete();
}

receive(function(){
  console.log("complete");
});
```

But, I can take this function, I'll cut it out of here and then assign that as the default function and then I'll rerun it and you'll see I still get complete.

```javascript
function receive(complete = function(){
  console.log("complete");
}){
  complete();
}

receive();
```
We can make this a little bit shorter using the arrow syntax that I've covered before. If I do that and then get rid of the braces and then bring everything up to the same line, you can see that I can assign a default function, all within that same line, run it again, and I still get complete.

```javascript
function receive(complete = () => console.log("complete")){
  complete();
}
```
If you want to go completely crazy with arrow functions, which I don't recommend, you could go let receive and I'll assign it to an arrow function, delete these braces, pull everything up to the same line, and then just invoke it this way. It still runs and this just doesn't look like JavaScript.
```javascript
let receive = (complete = () => console.log("complete")) => complete();
```

It's not a JavaScript you'd write, but it's very unfamiliar with the new syntax, with the arrow functions and the default assignments all working on the same line.
