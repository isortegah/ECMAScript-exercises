ES6 or ES2015 introduces a standardized module format. I have an `index.html` file here and I've loaded it here just for the browser sync server so that we can get some live reloading. I go ahead and type this, we'll say, `With Webpack and Babel`. See that reloads. We may have an entry point already set up.

If I just log to the console, let's create a function here, that's going to sum two numbers and take A and B, `sumTwo(a, b)` and will just return that, `A + B`. If we want to log that out, we'll just say this, `2 + 3`. I want to take the result of this, two and three.
```javascript
function sumTwo(a,b){
  return a + b;
}
console.log(
  "2 + 3",
  sumTwo(2,3) // 5
);
```
Let's extract this `sumTwo` function now into an `addition` module. Unlike here in our `src` Directory, we'll just create a new file, and we'll put this within a `math` Directory, and we'll call this `addition.js`.

See that we have this `sumTwo` and we need a way of exposing this. That's going to look like this. We can `export`. We'll just give it the name of the function. That's going to expose the `sumTwo` function when we import the module.

## math/addition.js
```javascript
function sumTwo(a,b){
  return a + b;
}
export { sumTwo }
```

What that looks like, we can say, import. We'll just `import { sumTwo } from`...if we look at our directory structure, we had had the math/addition Expand that.

## main.js
```javascript
import { sumTwo } from `math/addition`;
```
Now, let's add another function to the `addition` Module. We will add three numbers together, two plus three plus four. We'll just create this. We'll call this `sumThree()`.

## main.js
```javascript
console.log(
  "2 + 3 + 4",
  sumThree(2, 3, 4)
);
```
Now, we're going to import that the same way. We'll add it to this list here, `sumThree`. Now, let's just define that. Now, let's export that. Add it to our Exports,  `sumThree`.

## math/addition.js
```javascript
function sumThree(a, b, c){
  return a + b + c;
}

export { sumTwo, sumThree }
```
We can see over here that we are importing that successfully. Now, there's a few variations of how we can accomplish both importing and our exporting. Let's take a look at maybe how we can export this little differently. You can actually export directly on a Function Definition like this. We can just say, `Export, Export`. I'm going to drop this and we're still reloading just the same.

## math/addition.js
```javascript
export function sumTwo(a, b) { ... }

export function sumThree(a, b, c) { ... }
```
There's a few different ways that we can import these. Let's take a look at a few. We give this a little more breathing room. We can give each of our import statements an alias.

We can `import sumTwo as addTwoNumbers`. If we run this, we'll see that `sumTwo` is not `defined`. If we update this to use our alias, addTwoNumbers.

## main.js
```javascript
import {
  sumTwo as addTwoNumbers,
  sumThree
} from 'math/addition';
```
Now, let's import the module as a whole. We'll just copy this path here and we'll say, `Import * as addition from` our path. We'll drop this import statement and we just need to make a few updates here, this is going to be called `sumTwo`.

Since we're importing the module as a whole `as addition`, these are going to be on the `addition` object. Let's update these numbers just so we can see a little more change on that side.

## main.js
```javascript
import * as addition from 'math/addition';

console.log(
  "1 + 3",
  addition.sumTwo(1, 3) // 4
);

console.log(
  "1 + 3 + 4",
  addition.sumTwo(1, 3, 4) // 8
);
```
We've seen how we can define and import our own custom modules. Let's import a third party package. Let's create a module for some dummy user data. I'm going to just call this `data/users.js`

I'm pasting this array of users that I have here. We'll make sure that we export that.

## data/users.js
```javascript
var users = [
  { 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36, 'active': false, 'pets': ['hoppy']},
  { 'user': 'fred', 'age': 40, 'active': true, 'pets': ['baby puss', 'dino'] }
];
```
We'll head over here and we will `import users from  'data/users'` Module. Let's log that out and let's make sure that everything looks OK.

We have our object over here of our `users`. We drop each of those down. Let's pull `lodash` in and make use of the Where function that it provides us. `npm install --save lodash`. While that's installing, we'll go ahead and we'll just `import * as _ from 'lodash'`;.

## main.js
```javascript
import * as _ from 'lodash';

import {users} from 'data/users';
```
Now, we go to the alias, the `underscore` from `lodash`. We're going to be using the `_.where` method. Let's go ahead and use that `_.where(users, {age: 36})`. What we're going to be looking for is we want to grab at the age of 36. We should just get `Barney` back.

## main.js
```javascript
console.log(_.where(users, {age: 36}));
```
For the age is `36`. If you look at our results here, we got one `user` back with the name of `Barney`. I've covered a few usages of importing and a few different styles of importing and using aliases, exporting. We thought we can export our functions directly.

If you're looking for more information, head over to MDN documentation, or Babel has some pretty good summaries of the ES6 modules syntax.
