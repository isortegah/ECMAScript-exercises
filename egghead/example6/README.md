ES6 comes with some object enhancements. If I want to create a car with that color and speed, I can just say {color, speed} and then log out car.color and car.speed. When I run this, you can see I get red and 10.
```javascript
var color = "red";
var speed = 10;

var car = {color, speed};

console.log(car.color); // "red"
console.log(car.speed); // 10
```
That's because if you declare a property with the exact same name as something, it'll treat it just as if you did color:color and speed:speed. This is the ES5 way, and this is the ES6 way.
```javascript
// ES6
var car = {color, speed}

// ES5
var car = {color:color, speed:speed};
```
This even works for functions. If I create a function called go and say vroom, I can simply add another property here, call it go, and then say, car.go(). Then I'll run this. You can see it says, vroom.
```javascript
var color = "red";
var speed = 10;
function go() {
  console.log("vroom");
}

var car = {color, speed, go};

car.go(); // "vroom"
```
Another cool thing...I'm going to format this just a little bit, put these on new lines...is that instead of using the function keyword, I can actually cut and paste this here. Then I'll just delete that. This is valid syntax for declaring a function on an object. If I save and run again, you'll see I get the same result.
```javascript
// ES6
var car = {
  color,
  speed,
  go(){
    console.log("vroom");
  }
};
```
This is the ES6 way, and that's the ES5 way. It's basically a shorthand that saves you some typing.
```javascript
// ES5
var car = {
  color,
  speed,
  go: function(){
    console.log("vroom");
  }
};
```
The last fun trick to show you is that if you type something like this, you can actually have a computed property where it'll evaluate this. This is pretty much just like if you were to do car["go"] like that, but now you're doing it inline inside of an object declaration.
```javascript
var car = {
  color,
  speed,
  ["go"]: function(){
    console.log("vroom");
  }
};
```
This will still work when I run it. I ran it and got vroom still. I can actually extract this go. I'll cut that out, say var drive, paste it in there. Then we can put drive in here, hit save, run it. We still get vroom.
```javascript
var drive = "go";
var car = {
  color,
  speed,
  [drive]: function(){
    console.log("vroom");
  }
};
```
You could do any sort of string concatenation or evaluation in there to generate some sort of string, which would evaluate into the name of something that you could then call later on.
